# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve text visibility and contrast throughout the application to ensure all text is easily readable.

**Planned changes:**
- Update text colors to ensure optimal contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliance: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Enhance text visibility in HeroSection over the furnace background image
- Improve text readability in ContactSection over the refinery interior background
- Strengthen contrast for ProductCard titles and purity badges
- Optimize text colors in LiveRatesDashboard for price displays and percentage changes

**User-visible outcome:** All text elements across the application will be clearly readable with improved contrast, making content easier to read without strain while maintaining the existing metallic gold/silver aesthetic.
